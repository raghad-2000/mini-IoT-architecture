# Mini IoT Architecture

This project aims to use the various skills you have acquired during the practical sessions to allow you to set up an Internet of Things architecture, such as:

  1. Developing a network protocol to establish communication between a device and a gateway.     
  2. Programming a microcontroller so that it can collect data and send it in a specific format, as well as receive data from the gateway to display on an OLED screen.     
  3. Programming a gateway so that it can receive data from a client, manipulate it, store it, and send it to the next client in a specific format.      
  4. Developing an Android application capable of connecting to a server to request data and display it, as well as sending configurations to a connected device.
